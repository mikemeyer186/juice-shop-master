## About OWASP Juice Shop

The OWASP Juice Shop is a vulnerable web application developed by Björn Kimminich. It serves as a security training platform designed to help developers, security professionals, and ethical hackers learn about web application vulnerabilities in a hands-on and interactive way. The OWASP Juice Shop was created to provide a realistic environment for practicing security testing techniques, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. It includes a wide range of common security flaws, such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Broken Authentication, and Security Misconfigurations and a lot more  vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten. The application is widely used in cybersecurity training, Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, and DevSecOps education. It is an open-source project and available for local deployment, ensuring a controlled and legal environment for learning about web application security.
